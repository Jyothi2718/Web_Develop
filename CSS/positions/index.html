    <h1>Positions in CSS</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Static : The original or default position of an element. </li>
        <li>Relativen: Element is positioned relative to it's normal/original position.
          Same as static positioning, just that here we can move elements by adding  offset values.
          Elements stays in normal document flow.
        </li>
        <li>Absolute : Elements is positioned relative to its's parent.
            If parent is no  present, then element is positioned relative to the main document.
            Element is removed from the normal document flow, no space is created for that element.
        </li>
        <li>Fixed : Element is positioned relative to the viewport.
            Element doesn't move and stays in the same position even after scrollling.
            Element is removed from the normal flow.
        </li>
        <li>Sticky : Element is positioned according to the normal flow.
            Till hits the top, it has normal position, after it touches the top it becomes fixed.</li>
